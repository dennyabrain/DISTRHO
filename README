-  README for DISTRHO  -
-----------------------

DISTRHO is an open source project that has the goal of making cross-platform plugins and Linux LV2 ports.
The DISTRHO Team currently has 2 members - falkTX (the coder) and nieee (graphics designer).

The source repository is layered out this way:
 bin/                 - directory where all the compiled binaries will be placed
 libs/                - libraries
 libs/distrho-ports/  - disthro own code to take care of standard-to-standard conversion, currently only has a small vst-to-lv2 helper
 libs/juce-2.0/       - juce 2.0 source code and build scripts
 libs/juce-lv2/       - juce lv2 wrapper code
 libs/juce-plugin/    - disthro own juce code, created to make building separate plugin types easy (Standalone, VST and LV2)
 plugins/             - plugins developed and/or designed by the DISTRHO Team
 ports/               - all plugin ports (plugins not made by us) will be placed here
 scripts/             - build scripts
 sdks/                - SDKs must be placed here (ASIO SDK and VST SDK)



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---- BUILD and INSTALL

In order to build the plugins, first run:

$ ./scripts/premake-update.sh _OS_

where _OS_ can be 'linux', 'mac' or 'windows'. This operation requires 'premake' (version 3) to be installed on your system.
On Linux and MacOS this will create a set of Makefiles, on Windows it will generate VC-2005 projects.


You are now ready to start building. If you run Linux or MacOS, run this on the source root folder:

$ make

If you just want to build specific plugin versions, you can use 'make standalone', 'make lv2' or 'make vst' to build their respective versions.
On Windows, you need to go through all build folders and open the VC-2005 projects one at a time and compile them.


When you're done, and if you built LV2 versions (yes by default), run this:

$ make gen

to generate to static LV2 turtle data.


Note that some plugins may require extra files to be installed on your system in order to work.
We created a README for each one them. Currently they are:

 - ports/hybridreverb2/

---- BUILD DEPENDENCIES

To build plugins, you first need to install the following dependencies:

 All OSes:

- premake
- Qt4


 Linux: (development versions of these)

- ALSA
- JACK
- freetype2
- X11 core
- X11 extensions (Xinerama, X Shared memory/Xshm, XRender and XCursor)
