This folder contains the audio samples used by VEX's oscillator.

You can add samples by just dropping them in here. The practical limit is about 50 waveforms.

The format is raw unsigned 2-byte integer, no fluff. 

The file name extension has to be ".raw".

Files that are 1k (512 sampels) sit better in the CPU cache and result in less cpu use.

The sample size should be a power of 2.

The pitch has to be 86 HZ or possibly 172 HZ to fit evenly.
