mlrVST
======

VST port of the popular monome app using JUCE. At this stage, the app is very much in the experimental phase, so code is quite possibly not in a working state! 

Current Status
--------------

UI is starting to take shape (at least in terms of functionality). Variable number of channels can be set at runtime.
Basic sample playback can be done. Incoming OSC messages can trigger samples.


Possible Upcoming Features
-------------------------
- ADSR envelopes for samples (maybe make advanced options).
- configurable number of channels
- loop current block only on hold down button
- Also load MIDI tracks into strips
- Speed independent pitch control of samples
- 64 bit version?
- proper sample management
